      <description>AOO !!!! As times have changed, the demands of the marketplace on our company have increased markedly. We recognize that competitors operating at world-class levels of performance - in quality, cycle time, cost efficiencies, and new product development - are a likely part of our future. We are now better able to understand the importance of our customers&amp;rsquo; needs, and quality has a new meaning. To become a world-class company will demand flexibility, teamwork, competencies, and focused improvements that we would have found nearly inconceivable a few years ago; and it won&amp;rsquo;t be possible without the full involvement and engagement of every person in the company.</description>
